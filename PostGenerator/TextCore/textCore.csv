josephjacques1976@vp.pl We previously saw this same list of email addresses with another scam about eBay and an “Axel Panel Platform Bed.” According to a test done with a temporary email account, as of 2022, signing up for an account on Pornhub resulted in the company sending an email with the subject line: “Activate your new Pornhub account.” The message came from noreply@pornhub.com, a genuine email account owned by Pornhub.",We are really excited that you joined: Porn Hub,"scam , A subscription confirmation email with the Pornhub name comes from an email address that doesn't end with @pornhub.com.
