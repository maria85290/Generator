# Post Generator based on emotions and personality
Repository to develop the Post Generator based in emotions and personality. 

Social networks are currently one of the main sources of dissemination of fake-news. On the other hand, fact-checking agencies, which emerged with the aim of solving the problem of fake-news, find it difficult to spread their content on social media. The engagement of fake-news is considerably greater than that of fact-checking. In this sense, we design and develop a Post Generation Algorithm based on emotions and personality capable of increasing the engagement of fact-checking posts. The algorithm was tested in an experiment carried out with twenty participants, where patterns were searched between the posts obtained by the algorithm and those created by the fact-checking journal Snopes and the interactions achieved in each of them. This experiment, carried out in a lab environment, proved the hypothesis that emotions and personality in Microblog posts increase user engagement with fact-checking posts.
